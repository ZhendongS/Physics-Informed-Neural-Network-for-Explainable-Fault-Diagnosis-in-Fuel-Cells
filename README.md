# Physics-Informed-Neural-Network-for-Explainable-Fault-Diagnosis-in-Fuel-Cells
We present an online, physics-informed neural network (PINN) that embeds voltage, thermal, and gas stoichiometry models to ensure multi-physics consistency. An uncertainty-aware detection mechanism combining model residuals with Monte Carlo dropout-based epistemic uncertainty provides probabilistic early warnings.
